            <div class="pl-2">
                <h6>Basic Procedure</h6>
                <p class="mt-n2">Your order will be processed within 1 business day and delivered to you within 3-7 business days
                    following the order confirmation email and/or SMS.</p>
                <p>As a standard procedure you will not be contacted when the order is dispatched or prior to the
                    delivery being made. As we work with multiple delivery partners, each of them have their own
                    channels of communications, such as text messages, emails, or calls. Typically, the delivery
                    partner may contact the customer prior to their arrival, but we cannot guarantee that. If you are
                    not available at the time of the delivery attempt, they will try and contact you. If they are unable to
                    deliver the product/item, our courier partner will schedule one more re-delivery attempt at another
                    time on the same day or on a later date.</p>
                <p>All packages need to be signed for at delivery and once signed for Surya Shri does not take
                    responsibility for damages caused after delivery.</p>
                <p>If you are unable to accept the package in person please inform a trusted person to accept &
                    sign for it in your place. However Surya Shri takes no responsibility for deliveries signed by an
                    alternative person.</p>
                <p>Note that delivery charges may vary depending on products, quantity, type, etc. You can know
                    exact delivery charges for your purchase at the checkout, before making your payment.</p>
                <small>Tracking an Order</small>
                <p class="mt-n1">You can track your order by clicking on ‘______________. Select ‘Your Orders’ in the drop down
                    menu to view details of your purchases.</p>
                <p>Select the item / order you want to track and click “View”. The current status of the order
                    (pending pick-up / in-transit / dispatched for delivery) will be displayed against it.</p>
                <small class="mt-2"><strong>Issues relating to the delivered items</strong></small>
                <p class="mt-n1">The parcel being delivered can only be opened, after you have signed for the package.

                    team here within 24 business hours from time of delivery for complaints.</p>

                <small class="mt-2"><strong>Operating hours of SURYA SHRI delivery service</strong></small>
                <p class="mt-n1">Multiple delivery partners are in association with SURYA SHRI. Hence, the operating hours for
                    each delivery partner may differ. However, you can expect your delivery between 8:00am to
                    7:00pm</p>
                <p>Our delivery partners may contact you prior to the delivery attempt in order to coordinate the
                    exact time and location of delivery</p>

                <small class="mt-2"><strong>Misplaced deliveries post a delivery confirmation notice</strong></small>

                    will be happy to assist you.</p>

                <small class="mt-2"><strong>Unmatched delivery to the ordered description</strong></small>
                <p class="mt-n1">Generally, we try to bundle all items to one delivery as much as possible (where multiple sellers
                    are involved). But there can be instances where lead times differ between sellers. At such times,
                    you may receive the items of your order across multiple deliveries.</p>
                <p>However, if you ordered all the items from one seller and still find some items missing in your
                    parcel, then please reach out to our customer care team by clicking here, and we will resolve the
                    matter for you right away.</p>

                <small class="mt-2"><strong>Delivery time period</strong></small>
                <p class="mt-n1">SURYA SHRI does not offer next day (within 24 hours) delivery as a guaranteed service at the
                    moment. However, please be rest assured that we will try our best to ensure your parcel is
                    delivered within the agreed delivery time or prior, given the circumstances.</p>
